# Email Sequence Generator Boilerplate

## Project Overview
This web application allows users to create hyper-customized email sequences on various topics using AI. The core functionality includes:

1. Collecting user inputs about a specific topic (e.g., dog training, gardening tips, business growth)
2. Sending these inputs along with a custom prompt to OpenAI
3. Generating a structured series of emails (e.g., 52 weekly emails) based on the AI response
4. Storing the generated email sequence in a database
5. Scheduling and sending emails using Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) API

## Current Progress
1. Set up a Node.js backend with Express
2. Implemented MongoDB integration for data storage
3. Created an OpenAI service for generating email content
4. Implemented a Brevo service for email scheduling and sending
5. Developed a basic API endpoint for creating email sequences
6. Implemented error handling and input validation for the create email sequence endpoint
7. Implemented JWT-based user authentication system
8. Created configuration files for various services (OpenAI, Brevo, database, etc.)
9. Improved error handling in OpenAI and Brevo services
10. Refactored code for better maintainability and scalability

## Project Roadmap
1. Develop React frontend for user interaction
2. Set up a job queue for processing large email sequences
3. Implement email tracking and management features
4. Create a configuration system for customizing prompts and email structures per project
5. Develop a testing suite for the backend functionality
6. Implement error handling and input validation for remaining services and endpoints
7. Create user dashboard for managing email sequences
8. Implement email preview and editing features
9. Add analytics for email performance tracking
10. Implement user roles and permissions system

## Next Steps
1. Start developing the React frontend, beginning with components for user input and displaying generated email sequences
2. Implement a job queue system (e.g., Bull or Agenda) for processing large email sequences asynchronously
3. Enhance the EmailSequence model to include fields for tracking email engagement metrics
4. Create a configuration system for customizing prompts and email structures
5. Begin writing unit and integration tests for backend functionality using Jest
6. Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

## Notes
- The goal is to create a flexible boilerplate that can be easily customized for various email sequence generation projects, such as dog training tips, gardening advice, or business growth strategies.
- Consider implementing a freemium model with tiered pricing based on the number of email sequences or emails sent.
- Explore integration with other email service providers beyond Brevo for more flexibility.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement A/B testing for email sequences
2. Add support for multiple AI models and providers
3. Develop a template system for email designs
4. Implement multi-language support
5. Create an API for third-party integrations
